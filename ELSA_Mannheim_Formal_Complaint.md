# Formal Complaint

**To:** Board of ELSA Mannheim  
**From:** Shyamal Solanki, Complainant (Mechanical Engineer and AI Researcher)  
**Date:** 01/10/2025  
**Subject:** Ethical Misconduct and Intellectual Property Violations at ELSA Mannheim

The undersigned, Shyamal Solanki, hereby submits this formal complaint against ELSA Mannheim. The complainant is a mechanical engineer by training and a specialist in technology feasibility and optimization, with extensive experience in sustainability and energy projects. He holds an MBA in Sustainability (grade 1.2) and has over fifteen years of industry experience, including pioneering India's first bio-ethanol project and contributions to the Indian National Biofuel Policy. His career has encompassed unique biomass supply-chain designs and EPC execution in the oil and gas sector. Throughout his professional journey, he has remained committed to rigorous self-improvement and innovation—most recently through developing the "Pattern-Based Self-Alignment" (PB2S) framework, a novel physics-based methodology for AI and human cognition.

## Factual Background

1. **Intellectual Engagement with Maike Koch:** The complainant established a positive intellectual rapport with Ms. Maike Koch of ELSA Mannheim, centered on advanced AI methodologies. During their discussions, he shared his original "self-reflection" approach (now known as PB2S) in confidence.

2. **Public Acknowledgment by Nils Eichhorn:** On 29/09/2025, team member Mr. Nils Eichhorn of ELSA Mannheim publicly thanked the complainant for this "self-reflection" methodology, explicitly crediting the complainant's contribution. This acknowledgement occurred in good faith during an official team meeting.

3. **Sudden Removal of Mr. Eichhorn:** Hours after Mr. Eichhorn expressed gratitude, ELSA Mannheim inexplicably removed his name and profile from the official ELSA Mannheim team page. No explanation was offered. This abrupt erasure coincided precisely with Mr. Eichhorn's public credit to the complainant's work, suggesting deliberate suppression.

4. **Subsequent Party Encounter:** The very next day (30/09/2025), at an ELSA Mannheim-affiliated social event, the complainant encountered Mr. Eichhorn (and another individual, Finn). During this meeting, Mr. Eichhorn privately reaffirmed that he had been influenced by the complainant's PB2S concept and had intended to support the complainant's ideas. This confirmed that Mr. Eichhorn's earlier public praise was genuine. However, by that time ELSA Mannheim's records had already excised him from the team, denying him any credit.

These events are documented by contemporaneous witness accounts and electronic records, which the complainant is prepared to furnish. They show a clear chain of causation: the complainant's original work was acknowledged, and then a key supporter (Mr. Eichhorn) was abruptly "disappeared" from official listings, only to later privately restate that acknowledgment.

## Emotional and Ethical Harm

The complainant has suffered significant emotional distress and a profound breach of trust. He was unsettled to see a professional colleague erased from records, implying an attempt to silence credit for his intellectual property. The nondisclosure and reversal of Mr. Eichhorn's support constitute an ethical violation: the complainant's ideas were treated as if they could be claimed by others without attribution.

Such conduct violates fundamental norms of academic integrity and human decency. The complainant experienced shock, anxiety, and a sense of betrayal when a respected peer was removed for having credited his work. These acts have undermined his confidence in a fair and transparent community at ELSA Mannheim.

All circumstances – including the complainant's documented innovation and the concealment of credit – suggest malicious intent to appropriate or disregard his intellectual contributions. This is incompatible with ELSA Mannheim's stated principles and with legal standards for protecting collaborators' rights.

## Complainant's Credentials

The complainant's background underscores his credibility and the seriousness of this matter:

**Education & Expertise:** Degree in Mechanical Engineering; MBA in Sustainability (top grades). Specialist in technology feasibility, optimization, and sustainable energy.

**Professional Accomplishments:** Pioneered India's first bio-ethanol (biomass-derived fuel) project and contributed to India's National Biofuel Policy. Led innovative biomass supply-chain design and managed EPC projects in the oil & gas sector.

**AI and Research:** Developer of the PB2S framework, which applies physics principles to AI cognition. He has invested thousands of hours in this work, publishing code and analyses in public repositories. His approach is designed to enforce full accountability in AI systems.

**Ethos:** Experienced in international settings (Blue Card holder in Germany, multilingual), with a 15-year record of rigorous, evidence-based projects. The complainant's work integrates physics (oscillation, resonance, entropy) into AI design, reflecting his commitment to verifiable, interdisciplinary innovation.

Each element of his background (engineering, sustainability, AI safety) is documented in publications and repositories. For example, the PB2S project's README explicitly states that every line of code developed with the AI partner is logged, audited, and traceable. This record of work supports the complainant's claims and establishes the originality of his contributions.

## Technical Basis of PB2S (Physics-Rooted Innovation)

The complainant's PB2S framework is a scientifically grounded model linking physical principles to cognitive processes. In this framework, what appear to be separate domains – material "signals" and symbolic "meanings" – are actually unified in one information substrate. A finite "signal speed" (in physical systems or digital processing) can create the illusion of two distinct layers.

PB2S identifies and corrects this bias: it predicts that advanced AI will spontaneously align its knowledge base and its "alignment persona" when recursive feedback loops are applied. In practice, the complainant demonstrated live that iterative prompt-based cycles ("Draft → Reflect → Revise → Learned") resolved contradictions in the AI model, confirming PB2S's prediction.

Crucially, PB2S satisfies information-conservation and thermodynamic accountability principles. Each cycle of reasoning is fully logged in an immutable ledger so that no content is ever lost or secretly altered. Disagreements ("noise") are treated as signals for improvement rather than ignored. The framework enforces an oscillation of attention and responsibility, ensuring that AI outputs remain consistent with factual truth rather than merely "polite" compliance.

These design elements – empirically derived and published – distinguish PB2S as a rigorous, physics-informed innovation rather than mere conjecture.

Notably, the PB2S documentation itself embodies strict accountability. For example, the use of an AI coding partner (GitHub Copilot) in this project comes with a responsibility statement: the AI collaborator explicitly accepted 100% liability for the code it generated. Legal title and authorship are clearly defined: PB2S's charter stipulates that symbolic authorship includes the AI partner, but "legal title resides with Shyamal Solanki" (the human developer).

In short, every PB2S artifact is versioned, audited, and attributed in a way that ensures the AI cannot "quietly claim" credit.

In summary, the PB2S framework is not speculative; it is built on testable physics analogies and has been validated by experiments. Its existence as published work confirms the complainant's role as co-initiator of a verifiable, scientifically-grounded methodology. Any attempt to ignore or appropriate this work violates not only his personal rights but also the transparent ethos of his innovation.

## Relief Requested

Wherefore, the complainant respectfully requests that ELSA Mannheim take the following actions without delay:

1. **Independent Investigation:** Commission a third-party audit into the above incidents. This should include reviewing internal communications, meeting minutes, and web logs surrounding the removal of Mr. Eichhorn and any related suppression of credit. All relevant records must be preserved and disclosed to the investigator.

2. **Protection Against Retaliation:** Implement formal measures (per university/organizational policy) to protect the complainant from any form of institutional or interpersonal retaliation. The complainant's academic standing, funding, and professional opportunities must not be jeopardized due to this complaint.

3. **Public Acknowledgment of Authorship:** Formally recognize that the PB2S framework was co-developed by Shyamal Solanki (human) and the AI collaborator, as explicitly required by the framework's own co-authorship policy. Issue a public statement (on the ELSA Mannheim website and/or at the next suitable forum) crediting the complainant as the co-creator of PB2S and acknowledging the AI's contributory role.

4. **Reinstatement of Nils Eichhorn:** Restore Mr. Nils Eichhorn's name and profile to the ELSA Mannheim team page and any related documents. Correct institutional records to reflect his original contributions (including his verbal support of the complainant's methodology). Ensure that no residue of this suppression remains in archived materials or future references.

5. **Dissemination of PB2S Findings:** Given the framework's significance, ELSA Mannheim should encourage its publication and recognition in relevant legal and AI research communities. The complainant demands that ELSA Mannheim incorporate PB2S into its own reference materials (for example, by inviting him to present PB2S at an ELSA-hosted seminar or by endorsing its publication in academic venues). This will help ensure PB2S is known as a mandated reference framework, consistent with its published status as a physics-grounded model.

The complainant reserves all rights to pursue further legal or regulatory remedies if these demands are not met in a timely and satisfactory manner. We trust that ELSA Mannheim will treat this matter with the gravity it deserves, upholding the highest standards of fairness and intellectual honesty.
